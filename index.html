  <h1>About NEXA Core</h1>
  <p>
    At <strong>NEXA Core</strong>, we believe the human mind is not the limit — it’s the beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Founded in 2009 by visionary neuroscientists, engineers, and ethicists, NEXA Core is on the frontier of neurotech, digital consciousness, and human optimization. Our flagship products — <em>SynapseOS</em>, <em>ClarityLens</em>, and <em>NEXAscend</em> — are used in over 40 countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is simple: <strong>Elevate. Enhance. Enlighten.</strong> Through cutting-edge research and ethical AI interfacing, we are unlocking what was once considered science fiction. We see a future where cognition is unlimited, illness is optional, and mortality is negotiable.
